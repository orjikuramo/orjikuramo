Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github, where i intend investing babyfoots till i come off as a giant. 
I have suddenly understood I have to push myself to more people instead of winning in my corner, hence my sudden usage of GitHub, medium and LinkedIn blog. 

Iâ€™m working on several projects using SQL, Excel and Power BI. ðŸ”­ 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, so I can move on from just analysing data to scientifically understanding it.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any data analysis project.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with remote jobs or maybe any freelance or hybrid jobs.
