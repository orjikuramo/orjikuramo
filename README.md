###Hi there 👋

<!--
**orjikuramo/orjikuramo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

🔭 I’m working on several projects using SQL, Excel and Power BI.
I have suddenly understood I have to push myself to more people instead of winning in my corner, hence my sudden usage of GitHub, medium and LinkedIn blog. 
🌱 I’m currently learning Python, so I can move on from analysing data to scientifically understanding it.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any data analysis project.
🤔 I’m looking for help with remote jobs or maybe any freelance or hybrid jobs.
