**orjikuramo/orjikuramo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on several projects using SQL, Excel and Power BI.
I have suddenly understood I have to push myself to more people instead of winning in my corner, hence my sudden usage of GitHub, medium and LinkedIn blog. 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, so I can move on from analysing data to scientifically understanding it.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any data analysis project.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with remote jobs or maybe any freelance or hybrid jobs.
